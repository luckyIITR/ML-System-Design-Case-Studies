## 📒 Framework for Making Notes from ML System Design Blogs

### 1. **Context & Metadata**

Before diving into content, note down:

* **Blog title**
* **Author / Source (e.g., company, individual expert)**
* **Date of publication**
* **Topic area (e.g., ranking, recommendation, serving, training pipeline, scaling)**
* **Main purpose (why is this blog written? what problem does it address?)**

👉 This helps you later to evaluate relevance and track sources.

---

### 2. **Problem Definition**

Every system design blog usually starts with a **problem or motivation**. Capture:

* **What problem is being solved?** (e.g., “scaling candidate retrieval to millions of users in <100ms”)
* **Why does it matter?** (business/technical impact)
* **Constraints/requirements** (latency, throughput, cost, accuracy, scalability, etc.)

---

### 3. **High-Level Architecture**

Note the **core building blocks**:

* Components (data pipeline, model training, feature store, serving infra, monitoring)
* Interaction between them (diagram if possible)
* Key **design pattern** being introduced (e.g., “two-tower retrieval”, “feature store for consistency”, “online/offline split”)

👉 Use simple sketches/boxes — visuals stick better than long text.

---

### 4. **Key Techniques / Solutions**

Extract **specific technical ideas**:

* Algorithms or models used
* Infrastructure choices (e.g., caching, sharding, batching, approximate nearest neighbor search)
* Trade-offs discussed (accuracy vs. latency, simplicity vs. scalability)

Make this section **bullet-point heavy** so you can revise quickly.

---

### 5. **Design Patterns / Principles**

From the solutions, abstract the **generalizable principles**:

* “Separation of candidate generation & ranking improves latency.”
* “Consistency between training & serving features avoids offline/online skew.”
* “Monitoring drift is essential for long-term system stability.”

👉 This is where you **learn patterns** beyond the single blog.

---

### 6. **Best Practices & Pitfalls**

Capture both sides:

* ✅ Best practices recommended
* ⚠️ Pitfalls / common mistakes mentioned

This helps when applying to your own projects.

---

### 7. **Metrics & Evaluation**

Note what metrics are emphasized:

* **System metrics**: latency, QPS, cost, scalability
* **ML metrics**: AUC, NDCG, CTR uplift
* **Business metrics**: retention, engagement, revenue

👉 Over time you’ll see which metrics recur across blogs → strong signal of industry standards.

---

### 8. **Case Study / Example**

If the blog provides examples (e.g., “YouTube uses multi-stage ranking”), capture them.

* Summarize real-world application in 2–3 lines.

---

### 9. **Your Reflection**

This is the most important but often skipped:

* What did you **learn**?
* How can it **connect to other blogs or concepts** you read?
* Can you **reuse the idea** in your own projects?

👉 This step makes the notes **personalized knowledge**, not just copy-paste.

---

### 10. **Cross-Links & Tags**

At the end, tag your note with categories like:

* “Ranking” / “Feature Store” / “Monitoring” / “Serving Infrastructure”
* Cross-link with your other notes on related blogs

👉 This turns your notes into a **knowledge graph** over time.
